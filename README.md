# Classification
There are two forms of data analysis that can be used for extracting models describing important classes or to predict future data trends. These two forms are as follows âˆ’

1. Classification
2. Prediction

Classification models predict categorical class labels; and prediction models predict continuous valued functions. For example, we can build a classification model to categorize bank loan applications as either safe or risky, or a prediction model to predict the expenditures in dollars of potential customers on computer equipment given their income and occupation.
